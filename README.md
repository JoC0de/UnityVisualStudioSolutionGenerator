# Unity Visual Studio Solution Generator

Visual Studio Solution Generator for Unity to improve developer productivity when working with multi-package unity projects.
This package intercepts the Visual Studio Solution generation done by Unity's [Visual Studio C# integration](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VisualStudioIntegration.html). It preforms the following changes to the solution / project files:

## Reduced project hierarchy

Placing projects next to code so the file hierarchy inside Visual Studio Solution Explorer is cleaner.

## Allow renaming files from local package dependencies

In the normal Solution generated by Unity projects of local package dependencies (see [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPackages.html#LocalMe) on how to create local packages.) are referenced as a 'Link'. This has the side effect that you can't rename the file using Visual Studio. The Visual Studio Solution generated by this package creates the project file (the '.csproj') inside the folder containing the local package therefor the '.cs' files are imported as normal files -> they can be renamed.

## Allow generating project file in the new SDK-Style

Currently the C# project files ('.csproj') generated by the Unity Visual Studio integration are using the legacy (non-SDK-style) project format normally used by .NET Framework. We provide a option to generate SDK-style project files.

Advantages of using SDK-style projects:

-   More default enabled [code analyzers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview)
-   The ability to easily add additional [code analyzers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview) as NuGet package e.g. [StyleCop](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.Analyzers/) or [Sonar Analyzer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SonarAnalyzer.CSharp/). See [Package Settings](#settings).

Disadvantages of using SDK-style projects:

-   The Visual Studio Unity Plugin doesn't detect the projects as Unity Projects this leads to some changes in the behavior of Visual Studio so e.g. to start debugging instead of 'Attach to Unity' you need to use 'Debug -> Attach Unity Debugger' ![Attach to Unity menu item](docs/img/attach-to-unity.png) ![Debug -> Attach Unity Debugger menu item](docs/img/attach-unity-debuger.png).

## Settings

This package tries to be customizable to match individual requirements. So it has many configuration options, they can changed using the Preferences UI that can be opened directly using the custom menu item 'Visual Studio' -> 'Preferences' or using 'Edit' -> 'Project Settings' -> 'Visual Studio Solution Generator'. All settings are stored per project inside the file: 'ProjectSettings/Packages/com.github-joc0de.visual-studio-solution-generator/Settings.json'. ![Screenshot of available settings](docs/img/settings.png)
